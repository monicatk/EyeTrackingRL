CV - Day
	we need 2 or 3 german - speaking volunteers
	july 7th, @hiwi palace
	present the project

pilot study, participants: jannis, arsenii, benjamin
	arsenii: test subject
	jannis: supervisor
	benjamin: minute writer - as always ;)
we need to be able to justify the questions in questionaire
	why do we ask which questions
	(= validate them)
experimental process (might be incomplete):
	-initial setup (before subject arrives)
		start all software
		plug in devices
		make sure, everything works
	-put devices on subject
	-calibrate devices
	-questionaire 1 (about the subject)
	-video 1
	-questionaire 2.1 (about video 1)
	-video 2
	-questionaire 2.2 (about video 2)
	-...
	-video 6
	-questionaire 2.6	
ratings on the video should be 'subjective ratings', 
	the subject needs to know, that he should not judge the quality of the video, but how much he personally liked it
	this is important
	(maybe make two ratings, an objective and a subjective one, just to make the difference clear?)
make sure to plan enough time for each experiment
	the pilot study took 30 minutes
	problems (like long and thick hair, technical issues or slow participants) makes the experiment longer
	letting other test-subjects wait too long is really bad
	be there 20 minutes+ before the subject arrives, to start all programs and make sure everything works
problem with eyetracker, when subject moves too much
	use a static chair!
	calibrate the eyetracker before each single video
we already have some subjects, but need some more (probably four more girls)
	there is a link on slack, where you can register new subjects

also, we need more 
experiments can theoretically start this thursday, as erliest
friday, arsenii is doing experiments with 3 subjects, you can join to learn how the devices and experiment works
there will be a manual, how to set up and execute the experiment

we also went to the lab and arsenii explained, how everything works
