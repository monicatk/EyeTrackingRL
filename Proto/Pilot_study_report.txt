2. Additional sound system needed.
3. How to open videos:
   - multiple tabs
   - create playlist 
4. Questionnaire: 
   - printed 
   - in another tab
5. "Go to main page" button doesn't work
6. All buttons in the right part don't work
7. Full screen button sometimes showed "half-full screen" or turned back to windowed mode
8. Logout works only on main page
9. No sign up functionality – may be ignored. Users will be created directly in the database.
