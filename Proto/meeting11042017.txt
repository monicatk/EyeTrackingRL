suggestions:
	experiment : split into categories.
	- find out, if our hypothesis works better for one or another category

	fix points color, depending on rating
	- like the higher the rating, the more green
	- or make groups, like group of persons with similar questionaire...

to-do list:
	finish questionaire
	- description of focus, interest etc, so user knows, what he is rating
	- tell the user, 

	decide, which videos! till next meeting!
	- must be videos, which polarize, like half of people like it and other half wont
	- maybe vids from youtube, with - 50% likes / 50% dislikes

	draft  till SATURDAY!!!!!!
